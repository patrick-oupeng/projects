# projects
My personal projects. I no longer have access to my previous git usernames (from college, and a previous employer). My previous github which I used in college and during an internship is here: [@tigerninjaman](https://github.com/tigerninjaman)

Currently I have a basic Amis autocorrect system, and some notebooks from the fast.ai Deep Learning course.

The [visual-novel](./visual-novel/) directory is the entire [Monogatari](https://monogatari.io/) engine and files for my dissertation, with the APIs redacted.
