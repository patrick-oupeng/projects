# projects
My personal projects. I no longer have access to my previous git usernames (from college, and a previous employer). My previous github which I used in college and during an internship is here: (https://github.com/tigerninjaman)[@tigerninjaman]

Currently I have a basic Amis autocorrect system, and some notebooks from the fast.ai Deep Learning course.
