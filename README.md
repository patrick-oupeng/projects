# projects
My personal projects. I no longer have access to my previous git usernames (from college, and a previous employer). My previous github which I used in college and during an internship is here: [@tigerninjaman](https://github.com/tigerninjaman)

There is a basic Amis autocorrect system [here](./Amis_AC.ipynb), some notebooks from the fast.ai Deep Learning course [e.g. here](./00-fastai-nb1.ipynb), and files for the Udemy GoLang course [here](./udemy-go). I may also various other files or code uploaded for small things, like converting text to CSVs or other minor tools that made it into the repo.

The [visual-novel](./visual-novel/) directory is the entire [Monogatari](https://monogatari.io/) engine and files for my dissertation, with APIs redacted. Made with [ABAIR](https://abair.ie/).
