# Irish visual novel - Monogatari
This is the repository for Patrick O'Neil's M. Phil project, using the Monogatari visual novel engine (https://monogatari.io). Monogatari provides the skeleton and overall structure for adding visuals, playing sounds, moving between screens, and other general actions. An additional input method has been added into Monogatari based on `web-dictaphone` which uses Irish ASR and TTS from the ABAIR project [abair.ie](https://abair.ie/), to allow users to give verbal input to the Monogatari engine.

This folder has been copied over from the private repository for my Dissertation, with API links wiped. The live game can be found at [visual-novel.abair.ie](https://visual-novel.abair.ie/).
